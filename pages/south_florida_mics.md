# Rules of the Page {#rules-of-page}
In an effort of fairness, the rules of precedence are as follows: 
1. Weekly mic has priority over non weekly mic
2. Comedy mic has priority over all arts mic
3. Up to admin discretion

In more efforts of fairness, mics will be added as location based,
with information about list and showtimes, or the necessary info you need
to be able to sign up properly. 

If you want more information for your mic, i.e. it's put on by such-and-such productions, please [contact me](mailto:max.haub@gmail.com).
