May or may not revist this in 2020 depending on how accurate it is. I’m the judge of how accurate it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-bonnie&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whybonnie.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Why Bonnie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Bonnie describes themselves as “bedroom-pop that moved to the couch,” which is so stunningly accurate I’m not going to try to best it. Why Bonnie released two EPs in 2018, “In Water” and “Nightgown,” both on Sports Day Records, and hopefully are releasing a full-length album in 2019. Lead singer Blair Howerton started Why Bonnie, and her voice can blend into their sweeping lo-fi sound if you’re not careful. And you really should be, because her lyrics are are wistful but uplifting. I actually lucked out and got to see them in their hometown of Austin, TX, opening for Beach Fossils, and I was an immediate fan. It was one of those experiences where everybody stops mingling and starts listening. Their performance of “Stereo” can quiet a room. What was more impressive is that we were outside at Mohawk. (Side note: if you’re going to a concert in Austin in July, wear shorts.) Since then, they’ve toured with Snail Mail on her late 2018 headlining tour, and are now back in Austin, with some shows lined up in the area, but they have no tour dates scheduled at the moment. Hopefully that changes soon, because I’d love for them to come back to New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the band members are named Bonnie. Why they’re named Bonnie, the world may never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite song: “Stereo”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;barrie&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://barrie.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Barrie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based out of Brooklyn, Barrie (the first name of lead singer/songwriter/co-producer/guitarist/synth/bassist Barrie Lindsay and also the name of the band) releases their first album, &lt;em&gt;Happy To Be Here&lt;/em&gt; on May 3rd, on Winspear. Their first EP, &lt;em&gt;Singles&lt;/em&gt; announced them as dream pop, synth-heavy, slow-moving, and easy to get lost in. “Clovers” is the first single released off of &lt;em&gt;Happy&lt;/em&gt; and and it’s already generating buzz, having been premiered on Apple Music, and featured on Tidal Rising (one of whose shows I got to see Barrie). “Clovers” has a more straigh-up pop sound, and when the guitar shows up in the chorus, it gives me a distinct Tame Impala vibe. I’m curious to see what the full album is going to sound like, but excited nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can catch Barrie on tour supporting Myia Folk this winter and spring, but I wouldn’t be shocked if they start their own headlining tour soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite song: “Tal Uno”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sports-boyfriend&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sportsboyfriend.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Sports Boyfriend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With three oficial singles released over the past three years, Sports Boyfriend might be the Venture Bros. of the Midwest DIY scene. Just like the Venture Bros, if Eileen Peltier’s songs take a while to be released, it’s only because they’re self-written, recorded, and produced to an exacting standard. With other recordings available on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/sports-boyfriend&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, Eileen’s sound becomes more and more defined, culminating in her recently released “Fear of God,” with chill baseline, backing guitar, clear vocals and extremely personal lyrics. With an upcoming EP promised via her Instagram, Sports Boyfriend might finally branch out of her mainly Chicago shows. She might not have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
